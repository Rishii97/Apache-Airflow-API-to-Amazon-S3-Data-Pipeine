# Apache-Airflow-API-to-Amazon-S3-Data-Pipeine
 This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the fetching, processing, and storage of data. It extracts CSV data from a specified API, transforms it to meet quality and format requirements, and loads the cleaned data into an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis or storage.
